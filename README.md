Sublime-ManiaScript
===============

ManiaScript syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Sublime Text 2 and 3.

##### This is a fork of the repo [ST2-ManiaScript](https://github.com/Tgys/ST2-ManiaScript)


Installation
------------

### Primary method
In Sublime Text 2, open the menu `Preferences -> Browse Packages...` and copy-paste the folder ManiaScript in there.

### Alternative method
These files should be placed into the package directory. For those on OS X, this can be found at:

`/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/`

For Windows, this directory is here:

`C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\`


Contents
--------

### Updated Syntax Coloring & Autocompletion

`ManiaScript.tmLanguage`
`ManiaScript.sublime-completions`

These files define a language grammar for syntax highlighting ManiaScript files. You'll get the following:
- SublimeText will automatically load this syntax when you'll open a .Script.txt file
- Highlight most of the ManiaScript classes/enums/variables
- You can autocomplete some ManiaScript functions and classes
